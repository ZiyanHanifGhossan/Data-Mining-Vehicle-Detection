Here's a general overview of the steps:

1. Installation: Install the necessary libraries, including Detectron2.
2. Data Preparation: Download and extract the dataset containing images and their corresponding annotations (bounding boxes for vehicles).
3. Data Registration: Register the dataset with Detectron2 in a format it can understand. This involves creating a function to load the annotations and image file paths.
4. Model Training: Configure a Detectron2 model (Faster R-CNN in this case) and train it on the prepared dataset. This process involves adjusting the model's parameters to learn how to identify vehicles based on the provided annotations.

Inference: Use the trained model to make predictions on new images, drawing bounding boxes around detected vehicles.
The goal of this code is to train a custom object detection model using Detectron2 to identify vehicles in images from the CrowdAI dataset. This trained model can then be used to detect vehicles in other images or video streams.
